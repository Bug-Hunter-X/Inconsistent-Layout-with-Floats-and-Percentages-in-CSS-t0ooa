The following CSS code provides a more robust solution:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.item {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This solution uses flexbox, which provides a more reliable and consistent way to create the desired two-column layout, irrespective of the parent container's width. The `box-sizing: border-box` ensures that padding and border are included in the element's total width, preventing unexpected width expansion.
